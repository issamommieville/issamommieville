- 👋 Hi, I’m @issamommieville across all social platforms
- 👀 About Me: constantly on a journey of learning, traveling being connected to the sea, the comfort, peace and quiet of home, my charming loving sweet children and simple but good food 
- 🌱 I’m usually drawn to anything unusaul and innovating. I am a jack of all trades, could probably sell you a pen, but I enjoy devoting my time to causes that bring help to people in difficult situations. I am a domestic violence survivor - and after suriving I have dedicated my life's work in the world of society to womens and children. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on investigating and creating AI based application that mentors and guides homeless towards a path to transition and connect personal data quicker for accessing services to health, housing, shelter, health care, food, and other social services programs and otherwise creating a network of "people in need" with nonprofits who have funding, avalaiblity and services to address needs.
